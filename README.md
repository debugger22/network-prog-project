#### This is the code for a project that I did for my course "Network Programming".

#### The problem statement:

Create a client-server application which uses wireless connection to transmit messages, small
files and ethernet for big files. The transmission should be seamless. If the size of file
crosses the threshold limit, the program should change the interface automatically.


#### Note:

The software uses UNIX socket for connection and is written in C++. It uses Qt for graphical
interface.
